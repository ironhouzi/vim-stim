==============================================================================
Section 1: Usage                                       *StImUsage*

StIm aims to improve the built in |star|-command with two adjustments:

    1. Don't jump to the next match on the initial issuing of a
       |star|-command.

    2. All consecutive spamming of * will jump to the next match.

The state will be reset by either of the following events occurs:

    1. User disables |hlsearch|.

    2. The word under the cursor is different from the previous use of
       star-command.

==============================================================================
Section 2: Why use the StIm plugin?                    *WhyStIm*

Vim users who don't like to have |hlsearch| activated by default, often do
so because they are constantly searching to perform arbitrary jumps, or
using searches as |text-objects|. Having |hlsearch| activated will in
these cases clutter the buffer for each minor jump or modification.
Vim users who still want to have highlighted searches can do so by using
this plugin.
The behavior of not jumping on the first press was found in Steve Losh's
vimrc, but the added functionality of spamming * to jump to the next match
was an itch that this plugin aims to scratch.

==============================================================================
Section 3: Mappings                                    *StImMappings*

The StIm plugin will remap * and g* to activate the StIm command and then
|hlsearch|.

The user is advised to have mapping to toggle or deactivate |hlsearch|.
Example:

nnoremap <silent> <leader><space> :set hlsearch! hlsearch?<CR>:call clearmatches()<CR>

or

nnoremap <leader>/ :let b:stim_virginstar=1<CR>:nohl<CR>

==============================================================================
Section 4: Variables                                   *StImVariables*

b:stim_virginstar               *b:stim_virginstar*
    StIm sets it to 0 everytime after StIm's * or g* bindings are used.
    Controls whether StIm will attempt to jump to the next search or not next
    time * or g* is pressed.

Section 6: Bugs                                        *StImBugs*

Currently, the StIm plugin does not take a [count].

The *#* command is not implemented and will not be done, unless
somebody issues a pull request.
